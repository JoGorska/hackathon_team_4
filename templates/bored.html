                    <h2>Bored</h2>
                    <P>Traditionally, boredom gets a bad rap because many people believe that the state of boredom
                        equates with a lack of productivity or focus on a given task.

                        However, some research has indicated that it is good to be bored because this state helps boost
                        creativity.

                        One way or the other, boredom is something we all have experienced repeatedly throughout our
                        lives, and according to some research, it seems that animals might share this experience with
                        us, too.
                    </P>

                        <h3>Embrace the Boredom!</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Acknowledge the feeling of boredom. Boredom is the feeling that has arisen, so accept it
                                in this moment.</li>
                            <li>Notice the thoughts running through your mind. Perhaps, "Ohhhh, I can't be bothered!" or
                                "What is the point of doing this?"</li>
                            <li>Get interested in boredom. Allow yourself to become curious. Where did the boredom come
                                from? Where's it going? Can you feel boredom in certain parts of your body? </li>
                            <li>Connect your attention to the sensations of breathing and see what happens to boredom.
                            </li>
                            <li>Try not to fear boredom when it hits you. Instead of saying "I'm bored" when you are
                                stuck in traffic, put some music on and allow your mind to wander.
                            <li>If you have children, let them be bored too. Allow their imaginations to run free and be
                                creative</li>
                        </ol>
