                    <P>Stress affects everybody in different ways.  What causes you to be stressed may not have the same effect on someone else. Many things can cause us to become stressed such as work-load, exams, relationships, traumatic events, illness.  This list can be endless.  It's not possible to remove stress from your life but it is possible to manage it.</P>
